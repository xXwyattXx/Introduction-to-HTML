        <h1>Dear Eileen,</h1>
        <p> Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>
        
        <h2>Starting dates</h2>
        <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
        </p> 
    
    </ol>
    <li>First Semester:9 September 2016<li>
    <li>Second semester:15 January 2017<li>
    <li>Third semester:2 May 2017</li>
        </ol>
    <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
    <p>You can find more information about important university dates on our website.</p>
